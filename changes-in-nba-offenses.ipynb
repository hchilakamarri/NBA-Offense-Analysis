The most interesting aspect of this is that shooting percentages have remained consistent throughout the past 18 years. Even though 3-point percentage has remained steady as 3-point attempts has risen dramatically, field goal percentage has also remained steady. This is likely because lower percentage 3-pointers are being offset by higher percentage 2-point shots. Even though the 3-point shot has a significantly lower make percentage than 2-point shots, the expected point value of taking 3 point shots is higher than the expected point value of mid-range 2-point shots. This can be observed in the modern game as the prevelance mid-range shooting (such as the playing styles of Kobe Bryant or Carmelo Anthony) has been largely replaced by deeper 3-point shot attempts (like Stephen Curry and James Harden). The slight increase in field goal attempts per game may be attributed to an increase in pace since the '00/01 season. These factors have likely led to the increase in average points per game in the past 18 years. Rule changes also likely made a significant impact on how the modern NBA game is designed and played. The most significant changes are those involved with zone defense, hand checking, and other contact since it allowed smaller players to drive to the basket which in turn creates more spacing for 3 point attempts. The statistical point advantage of taking 3-pointers and high percentage 2-pointers and changes to defensive rules have resulted in increased 3PA and higher scoring overall in the modern NBA."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
